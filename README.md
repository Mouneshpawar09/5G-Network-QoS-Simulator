# 5G-Network-QoS-Simulator
simulator to model a small-scale 5G Radio Access Network with multiple users (UEs). • Implemented QoS metrics including throughput, latency, and SNR using Shannon capacity and path-loss models. • Added support for scheduling algorithms (Equal Share, Proportional Fair) to study fairness in bandwidth allocation.
